    "text": "Welcome to my website!\nMy name is Geunchul Shin, currently attending University of Toronto majoring in African Studies and minoring in mathematics and statistics. It is a mix that shows my love for cultural insights with a small interest in numbers. But, life isn’t all about textbooks and equations for me.\nClick to see my resume\nClick to see my CV\nI am an international student born in Suwon, Korea. I’ve lived in Canada for almost a decade. For people who are not familiar where Suwon is located: this is where my hometown, Suwon is located.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I’m not deep in study, you can find me lost in a good game, strumming away on my guitar, catching the latest movies, or vibing to some great tunes. Each of these escapes offers me a different flavor of creativity and relaxation, shaping who I am outside the academic world.\nLooking ahead, I’ve got big plans to merge my creative side with my analytical skills by launching a marketing business in Korea. I’m drawn to Korea’s vibrant culture and tech scene, and I can’t wait to dive into the marketing sphere there, bringing fresh, data-driven strategies to the table.\nFUN FACT: (not really fun) The birthrate in korea has been decreasing significantly. I performed a simulation and put a visualization so that you can see how bad it is. Check out this cool interactive plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for visiting my website."
